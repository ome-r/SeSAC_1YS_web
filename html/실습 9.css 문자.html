        <p class="p1"> "As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me:
            this is exactly the place I've been looking for all my life.
            A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere.
            I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists.
            I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."
